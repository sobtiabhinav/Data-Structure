At Bryntum, we have since then been busy upgrading our code base to Ext JS 4. While we upgraded our scheduler and Gantt components we also took the opportunity to re-factor our code to make use of the new capabilities in Ext JS 4.</p><p>In the previous scheduler version, several key parts of the component relied on third party extensions such as LockingGridView, ColumnHeaderGroup, Maxim’s TreeGrid and Saki’s Ext.ux.form.DateTime. It’s a major step forward for us to have that functionality available natively in Ext JS 4, and we’re very happy that our components are now 100% based on code supported by Sencha. Here’s a look at the 2.0 scheduler version which uses the new Ext TreePanel.</p>'
